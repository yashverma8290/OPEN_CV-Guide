# OpenCV Features Project 🧠🎥

Welcome to the *OpenCV Features Project*, a collection of beginner-to-advanced level Jupyter notebooks and scripts demonstrating the wide range of functionalities available in OpenCV for computer vision tasks.

This repository is ideal for learners and developers who want to explore image processing, video handling, camera operations, drawing functions, and object detection with OpenCV.
